# Getting Started
## Installing Visual Studio Code

## Remotely Connecting
Let's start by connecting to a **remote server**

`$ this is a command to the remote server`

If this is your first time connecting to this server you might get a message that looks similar to this:
`â¤‡ ssh cs15lsp23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? `

Type "yes"

You should see something that looks like this
